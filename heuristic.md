Here's a structured approach to implement advanced heuristics in your chess engine:

---

### **1. Positional Bonuses**
**Goal:** Reward pieces for occupying strong squares (e.g., central control for knights).  
**Implementation:**  
- Create **piece-square tables** to assign positional scores for each piece type.  
- Example for knights (higher values for central squares):
  ```python
  KNIGHT_TABLE = [
      [-5, -4, -3, -3, -3, -3, -4, -5],
      [-4, -2,  0,  0,  0,  0, -2, -4],
      [-3,  0,  1,  1,  1,  1,  0, -3],
      [-3,  0,  1,  2,  2,  1,  0, -3],
      [-3,  0,  1,  2,  2,  1,  0, -3],
      [-3,  0,  1,  1,  1,  1,  0, -3],
      [-4, -2,  0,  0,  0,  0, -2, -4],
      [-5, -4, -3, -3, -3, -3, -4, -5]
  ]
  ```
- Add positional scores to the evaluation:
  ```python
  def evaluate(board):
      score = material_score(board)  # Existing material calculation
      for square in chess.SQUARES:
          piece = board.piece_at(square)
          if not piece:
              continue
          # Get positional bonus based on piece type and square
          if piece.piece_type == chess.KNIGHT:
              rank = chess.square_rank(square)
              file = chess.square_file(square)
              score += KNIGHT_TABLE[rank][file] * (1 if piece.color == chess.WHITE else -1)
      return score
  ```

---

### **2. Pawn Structure Analysis**
**Goal:** Penalize weak pawn structures (doubled, isolated pawns) and reward strong ones (passed pawns).  
**Implementation:**  
- **Doubled Pawns:** Two pawns of the same color on the same file.
- **Isolated Pawns:** Pawns with no friendly pawns on adjacent files.
- **Passed Pawns:** Pawns with no opposing pawns ahead on the same or adjacent files.
  ```python
  def evaluate_pawn_structure(board, color):
      pawns = board.pieces(chess.PAWN, color)
      doubled = isolated = passed = 0

      # Check for doubled pawns
      files = [chess.square_file(p) for p in pawns]
      for file in files:
          if files.count(file) > 1:
              doubled += 1

      # Check for isolated pawns
      for pawn in pawns:
          adjacent_files = [chess.square_file(pawn) - 1, chess.square_file(pawn) + 1]
          if not any(f in files for f in adjacent_files if 0 <= f < 8):
              isolated += 1

      # Check for passed pawns
      for pawn in pawns:
          is_passed = True
          opposing_pawns = board.pieces(chess.PAWN, not color)
          for opp_pawn in opposing_pawns:
              if (chess.square_rank(opp_pawn) < chess.square_rank(pawn) and  # For white
                  abs(chess.square_file(opp_pawn) - chess.square_file(pawn)) <= 1):
                  is_passed = False
          if is_passed:
              passed += 1

      return (-50 * doubled) + (-30 * isolated) + (20 * passed)
  ```

---

### **3. King Safety**
**Goal:** Penalize exposed kings and reward castling/pawn shields.  
**Implementation:**  
- Check if the king is castled.
- Count pawns around the king for protection.
  ```python
  def evaluate_king_safety(board, color):
      king_square = board.king(color)
      safety = 0

      # Bonus for castling
      if board.has_castling_rights(color):
          safety += 25

      # Penalize exposed kings (no pawn shield)
      pawn_shield = 0
      for delta in [-1, 0, 1]:
          file = chess.square_file(king_square) + delta
          if 0 <= file < 8:
              square = chess.square(file, chess.square_rank(king_square) + (1 if color == chess.WHITE else -1))
              if board.piece_at(square) == chess.Piece(chess.PAWN, color):
                  pawn_shield += 1
      safety += 15 * pawn_shield

      return safety
  ```

---

### **4. Mobility**
**Goal:** Reward players with more legal moves.  
**Implementation:**  
- Calculate the number of legal moves for each player.
  ```python
  def evaluate_mobility(board):
      if board.turn == chess.WHITE:
          return len(list(board.legal_moves)) * 0.1  # Weight = 0.1
      else:
          return -len(list(board.legal_moves)) * 0.1
  ```

---

### **5. Combined Evaluation Function**
**Integrate all heuristics with weights:**  
```python
def evaluate(board):
    # Material score (existing)
    material = material_score(board)
    
    # Positional bonuses
    positional = positional_score(board)
    
    # Pawn structure
    white_pawns = evaluate_pawn_structure(board, chess.WHITE)
    black_pawns = evaluate_pawn_structure(board, chess.BLACK)
    pawn_score = white_pawns - black_pawns
    
    # King safety
    white_king = evaluate_king_safety(board, chess.WHITE)
    black_king = evaluate_king_safety(board, chess.BLACK)
    king_score = white_king - black_king
    
    # Mobility
    mobility = evaluate_mobility(board)
    
    # Weighted sum
    total = (
        material * 1.0 +
        positional * 0.5 +
        pawn_score * 0.3 +
        king_score * 0.2 +
        mobility
    )
    return total
```

### **6. Optimization Tips**
1. **Precompute Data:** Cache pawn structure or king safety calculations during board updates.  
2. **Use Bitboards:** Leverage `python-chess`'s bitboard operations for faster piece checks.  
3. **Iterative Testing:** Validate heuristics by testing against positions with known outcomes.  
4. **Adjust Weights:** Experiment with weights (e.g., positional bonuses vs. material).

### **Example Test Case**
**Position:** White has a knight on e5 (centralized) vs. Black’s knight on a8 (edge).  
**Expected Behavior:** The engine should prefer the centralized knight due to positional bonuses.  

By implementing these heuristics, your engine will make more human-like strategic decisions! ♟️

## 1. Introduction

This report presents an analysis of a distributed chess engine implementation that leverages the Message Passing Interface (MPI) for parallel computation and a Pygame-based graphical user interface. The system utilizes parallel processing to distribute the workload of move evaluation across multiple worker processes, enabling deeper search depths and stronger play than a single-threaded approach would allow.

The main components of the system include:
- A minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for move evaluation
- MPI-based task distribution for parallel processing
- A graphical user interface for human-computer interaction
- Utility functions for serialization and logging

## 2. System Architecture

The system follows a master-worker architecture pattern:

### 2.1 Master Process
The master process (rank 0) has two primary responsibilities:
1. In console mode: Distributing tasks and collecting results
2. In GUI mode: Handling user interaction and coordinating with workers

### 2.2 Worker Processes
Worker processes (rank > 0) are responsible for:
1. Receiving board positions from the master
2. Evaluating positions using the minimax algorithm
3. Returning evaluation results to the master

### 2.3 Communication Flow
1. Master divides legal moves among worker processes
2. Each worker evaluates assigned positions
3. Workers return scores to master
4. Master selects the best move based on collected results

### 2.4 Component Interaction

- **chess_gui.py**: GUI implementation using Pygame
- **master.py**: Master process implementation
- **worker.py**: Worker process implementation
- **chess_engine.py**: Chess AI algorithm implementation
- **utils.py**: Utility functions for serialization and logging
- **run.py**: Entry point and process coordinator

## 3. Algorithm Analysis

### 3.1 Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning

The core of the chess engine is the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. This algorithm explores the game tree to find the best move by evaluating future positions.

```python
def minimax(board, depth, alpha, beta, maximizing_player):
    if depth == 0 or board.is_game_over():
        return evaluate_board(board), None

    legal_moves = list(board.legal_moves)
    best_move = None

    if maximizing_player:
        max_eval = float('-inf')
        for move in legal_moves:
            board.push(move)
            eval, _ = minimax(board, depth - 1, alpha, beta, False)
            board.pop()
            if eval > max_eval:
                max_eval = eval
                best_move = move
            alpha = max(alpha, eval)
            if beta <= alpha:
                break
        return max_eval, best_move
    else:
        min_eval = float('inf')
        for move in legal_moves:
            board.push(move)
            eval, _ = minimax(board, depth - 1, alpha, beta, True)
            board.pop()
            if eval < min_eval:
                min_eval = eval
                best_move = move
            beta = min(beta, eval)
            if beta <= alpha:
                break
        return min_eval, best_move
```

### 3.2 Position Evaluation

The `evaluate_board` function provides a material-based evaluation:

```python
def evaluate_board(board):
    piece_values = {
        chess.PAWN: 1, chess.KNIGHT: 3, chess.BISHOP: 3,
        chess.ROOK: 5, chess.QUEEN: 9, chess.KING: 0
    }
    score = 0
    for piece_type in piece_values:
        white_count = len(board.pieces(piece_type, chess.WHITE))
        black_count = len(board.pieces(piece_type, chess.BLACK))
        score += white_count * piece_values[piece_type]
        score -= black_count * piece_values[piece_type]
    return score
```

### 3.3 Parallel Task Distribution

The system distributes tasks among worker processes:

```python
def distribute_and_collect(board, depth):
    legal_moves = list(board.legal_moves)
    
    # Send tasks to workers
    for i, move in enumerate(legal_moves):
        board_copy = board.copy()
        board_copy.push(move)
        task = serialize((board_copy.fen(), depth - 1))
        dest = (i % (size - 1)) + 1
        comm.send(task, dest=dest)
    
    # Collect results
    results = []
    for i in range(len(legal_moves)):
        result = comm.recv(source=MPI.ANY_SOURCE)
        score, _ = deserialize(result)
        results.append((score, legal_moves[i]))
    
    # Find best move
    if board.turn:  # White's turn, maximize
        best_result = max(results, key=lambda x: x[0])
    else:  # Black's turn, minimize
        best_result = min(results, key=lambda x: x[0])
    
    return best_result
```

## 4. Complexity Analysis

### 4.1 Time Complexity

#### 4.1.1 Minimax Algorithm
The minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning has a worst-case time complexity of:

**O(b<sup>d</sup>)**

Where:
- b = branching factor (average number of legal moves, approximately 35 for chess)
- d = search depth

With alpha-beta pruning, the best-case complexity improves to:

**O(b<sup>d/2</sup>)**

This represents a significant improvement, effectively doubling the searchable depth.

#### 4.1.2 Distributed Processing
With n worker processes, the theoretical time complexity becomes:

**O(b<sup>d</sup>/n)**

In practice, the speedup is not perfectly linear due to communication overhead and load balancing issues.

#### 4.1.3 Board Evaluation Function
The evaluation function has a time complexity of:

**O(1)**

This is because it uses pre-computed piece lists from the python-chess library.

#### 4.1.4 GUI Rendering
The GUI rendering has a time complexity of:

**O(1)** per frame

The number of elements to draw is constant (64 squares + up to 32 pieces).

### 4.2 Space Complexity

#### 4.2.1 Minimax Algorithm
The space complexity of the minimax algorithm is:

**O(d)**

Where d is the search depth. This represents the maximum recursion depth.

#### 4.2.2 Board Representation
The python-chess board representation has a space complexity of:

**O(1)**

The size of the board is fixed at 64 squares.

#### 4.2.3 MPI Communication
The communication buffer size is:

**O(m)**

Where m is the size of the serialized board state, which is essentially constant.

#### 4.2.4 GUI Memory Usage
The GUI has a space complexity of:

**O(1)**

For storing piece images and board state.

## 5. Performance Evaluation

### 5.1 Scaling with Number of Workers

| Number of Workers | Effective Search Depth | Avg. Move Time (s) | Speedup  |
|-------------------|------------------------|-------------------|----------|
| 1                 | 3                      | 8.2               | 1.0x     |
| 2                 | 3                      | 4.3               | 1.9x     |
| 4                 | 3                      | 2.5               | 3.3x     |
| 8                 | 3                      | 1.4               | 5.9x     |
| 16                | 3                      | 0.9               | 9.1x     |

*Note: These are estimated performance metrics. Actual performance will vary based on hardware.*

### 5.2 Search Depth vs. Computation Time

| Search Depth | Avg. Positions Evaluated | Avg. Move Time (4 workers) |
|--------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| 1            | 35                       | 0.01s                      |
| 2            | 1,225                    | 0.1s                       |
| 3            | 42,875                   | 2.5s                       |
| 4            | 1,500,625                | 75s                        |
| 5            | 52,521,875               | ~40min                     |

*Note: These are theoretical estimates based on an average branching factor of 35.*

### 5.3 Communication Overhead

As the number of workers increases, communication overhead becomes more significant:

| Number of Workers | % Time Spent on Computation | % Time Spent on Communication |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| 2                 | 95%                         | 5%                          |
| 4                 | 90%                         | 10%                         |
| 8                 | 85%                         | 15%                         |
| 16                | 75%                         | 25%                         |

*Note: These are estimated percentages. Actual values will depend on network conditions and implementation details.*

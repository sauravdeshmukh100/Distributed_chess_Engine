Here's a detailed breakdown of forming the game tree, validating moves, designing the utility function, and choosing depth:

---

### **1. Valid Moves and Game Tree Construction**
#### **How to Know Valid Moves**
- Use the **`python-chess` library** to automate move validation.  
  ```python
  import chess
  board = chess.Board()
  legal_moves = list(board.legal_moves)  # All valid moves for current position
  ```
  - The library handles all chess rules (e.g., en passant, castling, check constraints).  
  - Each move is represented as a `chess.Move` object (e.g., `e2e4` for pawn advance).  

#### **Game Tree Structure**
- **Nodes:** Represent board positions.  
- **Edges:** Represent legal moves from one position to another.  
- **Branching:** For each node, generate child nodes by applying all legal moves.  
  Example for a root node:  
  ```
  Current Position (Root)
    ├── Move 1 (e2e4)
    ├── Move 2 (d2d4)
    └── ... (other legal moves)
  ```

### **2. Utility Function (Position Evaluation)**
#### **Basic Version (Material Advantage)**
Assign values to pieces and calculate the net score:  
```python
def evaluate(board):
    if board.is_checkmate():
        return -9999 if board.turn else 9999  # Checkmate prioritization
    
    piece_values = {
        chess.PAWN: 1,
        chess.KNIGHT: 3,
        chess.BISHOP: 3,
        chess.ROOK: 5,
        chess.QUEEN: 9,
        chess.KING: 0  # Not counted (game ends at checkmate)
    }
    
    white = sum(piece_values[piece.piece_type] for piece in board.pieces(chess.PAWN, chess.WHITE))
    black = sum(piece_values[piece.piece_type] for piece in board.pieces(chess.PAWN, chess.BLACK))
    return white - black  # Positive = White advantage, Negative = Black advantage
```

#### **Advanced Enhancements**
- **Positional Bonuses:** Reward central pawns, developed knights, or castled kings.  
- **Penalties:** Discourage isolated pawns or exposed kings.  
- **Mobility:** Count the number of legal moves available.

### **3. Search Depth Selection**
#### **How to Choose Depth**
- **Depth = 3–4:** Practical for testing (avoids excessive computation).  
- **Depth = 5–6:** Requires significant resources (suitable for distributed systems).  
- **Iterative Deepening:** Start with depth=1, incrementally increase until time runs out.  

#### **Adjusting Depth in Code**
Pass `depth` as a parameter to the Alpha-Beta function:  
```python
# Master sends depth to workers
comm.send((fen, move, depth), dest=worker_rank, tag=2)

# Worker uses depth to limit search
score = alpha_beta(board, depth-1, -float('inf'), float('inf'), False)
```

#### **Trade-offs**
- **Shallow Depth (2–3):** Fast but may miss long-term tactics.  
- **Deeper Depth (4+):** Slower but finds stronger moves.

### **4. Pseudocode Workflow**
#### **Master-Worker Coordination**
1. **Master** sends initial board positions and depth to workers.  
2. **Workers** recursively explore their assigned subtrees using Alpha-Beta pruning.  
3. **Utility scores** propagate back up the tree.  
4. **Master** selects the move with the highest score.  

#### **Alpha-Beta Pruning Logic**
```python
def alpha_beta(board, depth, alpha, beta, maximizing_player):
    if depth == 0 or board.is_game_over():
        return evaluate(board)
    
    if maximizing_player:
        value = -float('inf')
        for move in board.legal_moves:
            board.push(move)
            value = max(value, alpha_beta(board, depth-1, alpha, beta, False))
            board.pop()
            if value >= beta:
                break  # Prune
            alpha = max(alpha, value)
        return value
    else:
        value = float('inf')
        for move in board.legal_moves:
            board.push(move)
            value = min(value, alpha_beta(board, depth-1, alpha, beta, True))
            board.pop()
            if value <= alpha:
                break  # Prune
            beta = min(beta, value)
        return value
```

### **5. Recommendations**
1. **Start Simple:** Use depth=3 and the basic material evaluation.  
2. **Test with Forced Checkmates:** Ensure the engine prioritizes checkmate.  
3. **Benchmark Depths:** Compare speed and move quality at different depths.  
4. **Leverage Distribution:** Split the game tree across workers to handle deeper searches.  

With this setup, your distributed engine will explore valid moves efficiently while balancing performance and decision quality.
